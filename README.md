## mani-utils

`mani-utils` is a collection of scripts, that enhance the experience of using
[mani](https://github.com/alajmo/mani).
I created these scripts based on my workflow and will update them as my needs change.

The currently available scripts are:
- `mani-tag`: manipulate the `tags` attribute of your `mani.yaml` projects (see [more](/docs/mani-tag.md))
- `mani-init`: initialize and sync your `mani.yaml` with non-git directories (see [more](/docs/mani-init.md))
